When we have two sample $X$ and $Y$, we are interested in several things: correlation $\rho$ between two samples, the difference between the mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ for two samples. Next, we introduce two hypothesis tests for each topic we are interested.

### Correlation Tests
Correlation $\rho \in [-1,1]$ measures how one variable change along with the other variable. In practice, we concerned about there is a correlation between two variables.i.e.$\rho \neq 0$. Additionally, due to the dual equivalence between hypothesis test and confidence interval, we can contruct a corresponding confidence interval for the correlation. Based on our goals, we can contruct the following hypothesis test:

$$
\begin{align}
H_0: & \quad \rho = 0 \\
H_1: & \quad \rho \neq 0
\end{align}
$$
