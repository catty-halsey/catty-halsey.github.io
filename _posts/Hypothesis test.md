The hypothesis test allows us to test whether our sample (collected data) has certain properties. For example, we are interested in the mean, variance and other parameter of interest of one sample or two samples. In practice, we construct our test statistic to approximate the parameter of our interests. Now, the hypothesis test is provide us a tool to test whether our test statistic measure closely to our true parameter of interest or deviate from it. And if it close to the true parameter of interest, in what probability we can believe our results.
