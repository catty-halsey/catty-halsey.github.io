### 1. **The Purpose of the Theorem**
The theorem's goal is to **construct a transition kernel $P(x, \cdot)$** that:
- **Ensures Reversibility**: $P(x, \cdot)$ satisfies the detailed balance condition with respect to $\pi$:

$$
\pi(dx)P(x, dy) = \pi(dy)P(y, dx).
$$
  
Reversibility is sufficient to guarantee that $\pi$ is stationary for $P$.

- **Leverages the Proposal Kernel $Q(x, \cdot)$**: The theorem takes an arbitrary proposal kernel $Q(x, \cdot)$, as long as it satisfies the equivalence condition:  
$$
\pi(dx)Q(x, dy) \text{ and } \pi(dy)Q(y, dx) \text{ have the same null sets (support)}.
$$

It then constructs the acceptance probability $a(x, y) = \min(1, r(y, x))$, where:

$$
r(y, x) = \frac{\pi(dy)Q(y, dx)}{\pi(dx)Q(x, dy)}.
$$

Using $a(x, y)$, the kernel $P(x, \cdot)$ is constructed explicitly:

$$
P(x, A) = \int_A a(x, y) Q(x, dy) + 1_A(x) \left( 1 - \int_X a(x, y) Q(x, dy) \right).
$$


### 2. **What the Theorem Gives Us**
By constructing $P(x, \cdot)$:
- **Reversibility** is ensured: $P(x, \cdot)$ satisfies detailed balance.
- **Stationarity** follows: $\pi$ is stationary for $P(x, \cdot)$.
- **Irreducibility and Aperiodicity** are left to the proposal kernel $Q(x, \cdot)$: If $Q(x, \cdot)$ is irreducible, then $P(x, \cdot)$ will also be irreducible.

If $P(x, \cdot)$ is irreducible and aperiodic, the Markov chain governed by $P$ will converge to $\pi$, ensuring that the algorithm works.



### 3. **When Are We "Done"?**
We are "done" as long as:
1. $Q(x, \cdot)$ is **irreducible** (ensures all states can communicate, eventually exploring the full space).
2. $Q(x, \cdot)$ satisfies the equivalence condition: $\pi(dx)Q(x, dy)$ and $\pi(dy)Q(y, dx)$ must have the same null sets. This ensures $r(y, x)$ and $a(x, y)$ are well-defined.
3. The constructed kernel $P(x, \cdot)$ is used to generate the Markov chain.



### 4. **Why Is This Powerful?**
This theorem makes Metropolis-Hastings both **flexible** and **theoretically grounded**:
- You can choose almost any $Q(x, \cdot)$ as long as it's irreducible and satisfies the equivalence condition.
- The theorem guarantees that $\pi$ will still be the stationary distribution of the resulting chain, no matter the specific $Q$.
- The algorithm inherits the stationary distribution and convergence properties from the kernel $P(x, \cdot)$, which the theorem constructs.
