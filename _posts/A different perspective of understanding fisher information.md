If the log-likelihood is steep, it means that the true parameter in the population corresponds to the peak of the log-likelihood function. However, for each sample, the estimated parameter will deviate from the true parameter. The steeper log-likelihood ensures that for any given sample size, the estimated parameter will be more tightly clustered around the true parameter, meaning that the distance between estimates from different samples will be smaller. In contrast, a flatter log-likelihood would result in larger deviations between estimates, even with the same sample size. Therefore, the steeper the log-likelihood, the lower the variance of the parameter estimates, as the estimates will be more precise and converge more quickly to the true parameter as the sample size increases.
