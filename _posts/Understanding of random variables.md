Yes, you are correct in your understanding of random variables (RVs) and how they relate to the distribution of the sample space.

To break it down:

1. **Sample Space and Fixed Distribution**:  
   The **sample space** defines all possible outcomes for a random experiment. For example, when you roll a fair six-sided die, the sample space \(\Omega\) consists of \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). The probability distribution over the sample space describes how likely each outcome is. For a fair die, each face has a probability of \(1/6\).

2. **Random Variable (X)**:  
   A **random variable** \(X\) is a function that maps outcomes in the sample space to real numbers. The distribution of \(X\) depends on how \(X\) is defined. For example, if you define \(X(w)\) to be:

   \[
   X(w) = \begin{cases} 
   0 & \text{if } w > 4, \\
   1 & \text{if } w \leq 4,
   \end{cases}
   \]
   then \(X\) can be seen as a Bernoulli random variable with a probability distribution. Specifically, in this case, the value \(X = 1\) happens with probability \(P(X = 1) = P(w \leq 4) = 4/6 = 2/3\), and \(X = 0\) happens with probability \(P(X = 0) = P(w > 4) = 2/6 = 1/3\). Thus, \(X\) follows a **Bernoulli distribution** with parameter \(2/3\).

3. **Composition of Distribution**:  
   As you correctly pointed out, the distribution of \(X\) depends on the function \(X(w)\) and the underlying distribution of the sample space. If you redefine \(X\), it will follow a different distribution. For instance, if you define \(X(w) = 1\) for \(w > 3\) and \(X(w) = 0\) for \(w \leq 3\), then the distribution of \(X\) would change (in this case, it follows a Bernoulli distribution with \(P(X = 1) = 3/6 = 1/2\)).

4. **Different Distribution Families**:  
   It's important to note that while the distribution of the random variable \(X\) is determined by the way you define it (as a function on the sample space), the **distribution of the sample space** itself may belong to a different family. For example, the sample space of a die roll is discrete and uniformly distributed, but the distribution of \(X\), defined as a Bernoulli random variable, may not be uniform.

Thus, the **distribution of the random variable** is indeed a **function of the underlying sample space** and the way the random variable \(X\) is defined. Different functions \(X(w)\) lead to different distributions for \(X\), even though they are based on the same sample space.

### In summary:
- The **sample space** provides the raw outcomes and their probabilities.
- The **random variable \(X\)** is a function that transforms these outcomes into a real number.
- The **distribution of \(X\)** is determined by the function defining \(X\) and the underlying distribution of the sample space.
- The distribution of \(X\) can belong to a completely different family than the distribution of the sample space itself.
