Yes, your understanding is largely correct! Let's break it down step by step to reinforce your intuition:

### Weighting Intuition

The weight \( \frac{1_{\{X_i = x^*\}}}{P(X = x^* | Z)} \) can be interpreted as a way of adjusting for the distribution of \( X \) conditional on \( Z \).

- \( 1_{\{X_i = x^*\}} \) is an indicator function that takes the value 1 when \( X_i = x^* \), and 0 otherwise. This means you are focusing on the observations where \( X_i = x^* \).
- \( P(X = x^* | Z) \) is the probability of observing \( X = x^* \) given \( Z \). This probability tells you how likely it is to see \( X = x^* \) for a given \( Z \).

### Why Weighting is Necessary

- When **\( P(X = x^* | Z) \)** is **large**, it means that \( Z \) has a **strong influence** on \( X = x^* \). In this case, \( X = x^* \) is relatively **common** for that value of \( Z \). 
  - If you have many observations where \( X = x^* \) for a given \( Z \), then each of those observations carries less **additional information** about the causal effect of \( X = x^* \) on \( Y \), because \( X = x^* \) is more **typical** for that \( Z \).
  - So, in this case, you **down-weight** those observations (reduce their influence) in the reweighted sum. This helps correct for overrepresentation of certain values of \( X \) in the data.
  
- On the other hand, when **\( P(X = x^* | Z) \)** is **small**, it means that \( X = x^* \) is **rare** for that particular \( Z \), indicating that \( Z \) has less influence over the occurrence of \( X = x^* \).
  - Here, **fewer observations** correspond to \( X = x^* \), and therefore each observation carries more **informational value** about the effect of \( X = x^* \) on \( Y \). 
  - So, you **up-weight** those observations, which increases their influence on the estimated causal effect.

### Reweighting to Estimate the Effect of \( X = x^* \)

The idea behind the weight is to **reweight the observations** so that they become representative of the counterfactual distribution of \( X \) (i.e., if we had a balanced sample where the probability of \( X = x^* \) given \( Z \) were the same across all values of \( Z \)). This reweighting corrects for any **imbalance** in the data and ensures that the estimated effect of \( X \) on \( Y \) is not confounded by the influence of \( Z \).

Thus, after reweighting, you can treat the **reweighted values of \( Y \)** as the causal effect of \( X = x^* \), **adjusted for \( Z \)**. This makes the comparison of \( X = x^* \) across different values of \( Z \) valid.

### Summary:
- When \( P(X = x^* | Z) \) is large, \( Z \) strongly influences \( X = x^* \), so we **down-weight** the observations corresponding to \( X = x^* \).
- When \( P(X = x^* | Z) \) is small, \( Z \) has less influence on \( X = x^* \), so we **up-weight** those observations.

The goal is to **balance the influence of \( Z \)** on the distribution of \( X \), so that we can estimate the causal effect of \( X = x^* \) on \( Y \) without confounding from \( Z \).
