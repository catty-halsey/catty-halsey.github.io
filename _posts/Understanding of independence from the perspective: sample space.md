### 1. **Random Variables as Pushforward Measures**
- A random variable (RV) \(X : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}\) **pushes forward** the original measure \(P\) on the sample space \(\Omega\) to a new measure \(P_X\) on \(\mathbb{R}\). 
  - For a measurable set \(A \subseteq \mathbb{R}\), the probability \(P_X(A)\) is given by:
    \[
    P_X(A) = P(X^{-1}(A)) = P(\{\omega \in \Omega : X(\omega) \in A\}).
    \]

Thus, the random variable \(X\) essentially maps the sample space \(\Omega\) into a new space (e.g., the real line), and the pushforward measure \(P_X\) describes how \(X\) "distributes" the probability mass over \(\mathbb{R}\).

### 2. **Joint Distribution and Independence**
When you have two random variables, \(X : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}\) and \(Y : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}\), the relationship between their pushforward measures (and their joint distribution) defines their dependency structure.

#### Independence:
- \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent if the \(\sigma\)-algebras they generate, \(\sigma(X)\) and \(\sigma(Y)\), are independent. This translates into the fact that:
  \[
  P((X, Y) \in A \times B) = P_X(A) \cdot P_Y(B)
  \]
  for all measurable sets \(A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}\).

- **Interpretation**: Independence means the events determined by \(X\) and \(Y\) in the sample space \(\Omega\) do not influence each other. In terms of measures, the joint measure \(P_{(X, Y)}\) is simply the product measure \(P_X \otimes P_Y\).

---

#### Dependence:
- If \(X\) and \(Y\) are dependent, the joint measure \(P_{(X, Y)}\) cannot be written as \(P_X \otimes P_Y\). Instead:
  \[
  P((X, Y) \in A \times B) = P(\{\omega \in \Omega : X(\omega) \in A \text{ and } Y(\omega) \in B\}),
  \]
  where the dependency structure determines how the preimages \(X^{-1}(A)\) and \(Y^{-1}(B)\) intersect in \(\Omega\).

- **Interpretation**: The dependency reflects how the events associated with \(X\) and \(Y\) overlap or interact within the sample space \(\Omega\). This overlap changes how the joint distribution spreads its probability mass.

---

### 3. **Independence as Connectivity of Sample Spaces**
- You correctly observe that **independence** describes how the sample spaces of \(X\) and \(Y\) connect. If \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent, their respective mappings from \(\Omega\) are "decoupled," meaning that knowledge of one mapping tells us nothing about the other.

- **In terms of measures**:
  - For independent \(X\) and \(Y\), the measure of the joint space is built by **multiplying the measures** of their individual spaces:
    \[
    P((X, Y) \in A \times B) = P_X(A) \cdot P_Y(B).
    \]
  - For dependent \(X\) and \(Y\), this product rule fails because the mappings \(X(\omega)\) and \(Y(\omega)\) are connected (e.g., by a functional relationship, correlation, or common randomness in \(\Omega\)).

---

### 4. **Why Dependency Affects the Measure**
When \(X\) and \(Y\) are dependent:
- Their preimages in \(\Omega\) overlap in nontrivial ways. For example, the preimage of \(A \times B\) under the map \((X, Y)\) is no longer just the Cartesian product of \(X^{-1}(A)\) and \(Y^{-1}(B)\); it is a more intricate subset of \(\Omega\).
- As a result, the joint measure \(P_{(X, Y)}\) reflects this dependency structure and is not the product measure \(P_X \otimes P_Y\).

---

### 5. **A Visualization**
Imagine \(\Omega\) as a sheet of paper:
- \(X\) maps this sheet onto a real line, redistributing the mass according to \(P_X\).
- \(Y\) does the same, creating \(P_Y\).

If \(X\) and \(Y\) are:
- **Independent**: These mappings happen "independently," so the joint distribution can be formed by simply overlaying \(P_X\) and \(P_Y\).
- **Dependent**: The mappings are constrained by a dependency rule (e.g., \(Y = 2X\), or \(X + Y = Z\) for some random \(Z\)). This constraint alters how mass is spread in the joint space.

---

### 6. **Key Takeaway**
Your statement is correct: the independence of \(X\) and \(Y\) reflects how their mappings from \(\Omega\) to their respective spaces connect or overlap. Dependency means that the sample space of \(X\) interacts with the sample space of \(Y\), leading to a joint measure that is more complex than a simple product of \(P_X\) and \(P_Y\).
