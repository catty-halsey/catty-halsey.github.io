### Understanding Estimators, Random Variables, and Pushforward Measures

Your understanding of estimators $T$, random variables, and their connection to pushforward measures is correct and aligns with the foundational principles of probability theory. Below is a detailed synthesis of your ideas:

---

#### **1. Estimators as Functions of Random Variables**

An **estimator** $T$ is a measurable function defined on the \(\sigma\)-algebra generated by the random vector $X = (X_1, \dots, X_n)$, mapping outcomes from the sample space \((\mathbb{R}^n, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n))\) to \((\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))\). 

For any realization \((x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n\), the estimator $T$ produces a value $T(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}$. For instance:
- The sample mean:
  
$$
T(X) = \bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i,
$$

  is an estimator of the population mean.

When $T$ is applied to the random variable $X$, the result $T(X)$ is itself a random variable, measurable with respect to the Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra on \(\mathbb{R}\). However, when $T$ is applied to an observation \((x_1, \dots, x_n)\), the output is a single value in \(\mathbb{R}\) (no longer random).

#### **2. Measuring $X$: Probability Measure and Preimages**

The random vector $X = (X_1, \dots, X_n)$ induces a probability measure $P_X$ on \((\mathbb{R}^n, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n))\) through the pushforward of the original measure $P$ on the probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\). 

For a set $A \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the probability measure $P_X(A)$ is given by:

$$
P_X(A) = P(X^{-1}(A)) = P\big(\{\omega \in \Omega : X(\omega) \in A\}\big),
$$

where $X^{-1}(A)$ is the **preimage** of $A$ under $X$.

Thus, measuring $X$ corresponds to evaluating the probability of events in \(\mathcal{F}\) via the preimage of subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) under $X$.

---

#### **3. Pushforward Measure Induced by $T$**

The estimator $T$ acts as a measurable map $T: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$. By composition with $X$, it defines a random variable $T(X)$, and induces a **pushforward measure** $P_T$ on \((\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))\). 

For a set $B \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$, the pushforward measure $P_T(B)$ is:

$$
P_T(B) = P_X(T^{-1}(B)) = P\big(\{\omega \in \Omega : T(X(\omega)) \in B\}\big),
$$

where $T^{-1}(B)$ is the preimage of $B$ under $T$.

This describes how the probability mass from $P_X$ (on \(\mathbb{R}^n\)) is "pushed forward" to $P_T$ (on \(\mathbb{R}\)) via $T$.
